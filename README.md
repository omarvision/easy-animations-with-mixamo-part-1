# easy-animations-with-mixamo-part-1
I made the Franky model in Blender to show how to connect two meshes. But now to add animations. I can rig and animate right in blender. But, Since it is a humanoid model, I can easily get some animations from Mixamo to use in my unity game instead. Then I show you how I use the animations in a Unity project. Add them to an animation controller with parameters to control which animation plays. We add a script on the player to control the animations while we move our character.
